DTD

root element: nffgs.At least an nffg nested element is required. 
An nffg is described by name, update_time as attributes. The nodes (src/dst and others), 
the set of links and the policies are required as nested elements. 
Policies are not mandatory in the nffg.
Every node is described by two attributes, the name and the functional type, both of them are mandatory #REQUIRED.
Links are described by mandatory attributes for name,source and destination. 
A policy is by default a reachability one. Name,src,dst and positivity (only true false possible values) are mandatory attributes. 
A traversal policy has a nested element <traversal> adding information regarding the requested functionalities.
The set of available functionalities are listed in the ATTLIST of Functionality element. 
 
Elements that must be unique in the document are defined with ID, attributes that must be related
to these unique values are defined with the IDREF (meaning the content must be equal to an already defined ID)
 
Limits of DTD:
IDREF attributes are not connected to the correct element, i.e. it can refer to every ID in the xml document,
not only the type of element you should enforce.
